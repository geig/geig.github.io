					<h4>The Need</h4>

				</header>
				<p>Ghana a thriving middle – income state in West Africa is rich in resources however these resources aren’t equally distributed and accessible hitherto the prevalence of poverty.</p>

				<p>Higher education for female students especially demands attention. There has been a decrease in completion rates for girls in Junior High School, consequently growing the disparity in education for male and female students moving from primary through to Senior Secondary School. According to the Education Management Information System, EMIS of the Ghana Ministry of Education, Report on Basic Statistics and Planning Parameters for Basic Education in Ghana, published in May 2013 the net admission rate of all students in primary schools has decreased by 9.6% from 2011-2013.</p>

				<p>The percentage of girls enrolled(primary) increased by 1.15% however at the junior high school level the ratio of enrollment of boys to girls decreased by 1.2% from 2011-2013.</p>

				<p>Ghana’s 2013 population census had 51 %( 12,804,293) as females. GEIG is scalable because there is a great need to advance education for this population. “The completion rate for JHS decreased significantly from 2009-2010 after having reached a peak of 75 in 2008-2009. A positive trend has reemerged in 2010/11 but was not large enough to redress the initial fall from 2008/9.</p>

				<p>The completion rate is far short of the target required to achieve universal basic education by 2015 and Ghana does not appear likely to reach this target.   In underserved districts the completion rate is 13 percentage points lower at 57.0. This disparity in underserved districts is higher for the completion rate (GER for JHS3) than for the GAR (GER for JHS1) at 9 percentage points. This suggests that the gap in access between the deprived and non-deprived districts increases over the course of JHS.”</p>

				<p>Girls can harness their talents to become impactful when given adequate resources and opportunities.</p>
