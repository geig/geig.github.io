Currently, Kwabena is in charge of marketing and public relations for the Girls Education Initiative of Ghana. Kwabena is also the Communications & Development Manager (online internship) for The Asherah Foundation in USA. This role gives him the opportunity in leading online fundraising campaigns, creating donor communication strategies, drafting and publishing newsletters, creating content for website, and building the capacity of deprived women around the world through awarding postsecondary scholarships.
				<p>Previously, Kwabena has served as the Deputy Editor intern for Dorodrum (www.dorodrum.com) – a digital publishing organisation focused on connecting international African entrepreneurs and business experts with the young African entrepreneurial minds. He has also worked extensively with organisations such as Unilever Ghana Ltd, Marie Stopes International Ghana, International Youth Alliance for Family Planning (IYAFP) and Global Hand.</p>
				<p>Kwabena Agyapong graduates from University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA) in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA). He is the President of the Rotaract Club of UPSA from July 2016 to June 2017. He believes that inhibiting the growth of women is like inhibiting half of the world’s population from succeeding. Sadly, everyone is affected. Providing women with equal access to educational opportunities is a surest way in eliminating poverty, reducing gender-based violence, ensuring healthy families and resulting in a ripple growth in the country’s socio-economic development and global GDP.</p></p>
